    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Sydney Martin. I am a musician and multimedia student. I love how interdisciplinary multimedia studies can be, and am interested in pursuing this field whilst teaching music on the side. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, studying Music and Multimedia Communication. My expected graduation is December 2024. Click through and see what I've been up to my past four years!
